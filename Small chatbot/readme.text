The chatbot is ready to use, but it has two different modes.

In the first mode, I did not use an API. Instead, predefined questions and answers are provided, so the chatbot replies based on the given inputs.

In the second mode, there is a separate section where the proper API code is already written but currently commented out. To activate this mode, we simply need to uncomment and
enable the API and use that existing code.
